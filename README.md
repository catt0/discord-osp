# Super simple and hacky OSP integration for Discord
This script is designed to be called from [Linux Discord Rich Presence](https://github.com/trickybestia/linux-discord-rich-presence). Pass the path to webhook_server.py as -c argument.

You then need to register webhooks in your OSP instance to hit endpoints at IP:8888.

For more info, including the endpoints, read the source of the script for now.
